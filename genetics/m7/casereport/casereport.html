Complaint</B></U><B> </B>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">I have a broken
tooth because I had a deep cavity in that tooth.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><U><B>History of
Chief Complaint</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Growing up her baby
teeth were very small and brown.  Friends did not think she had
teeth. Her adult teeth were also discolored and caused her not to
want to smile fully.  Tiffany has had problems in the past with teeth
that have had root canals breaking and having to be extracted.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><U><B>Medical
History</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">She has no known
drug allergies and is not currently taking any medications.  Her
mother’s pregnancy with her was normal as far as she knows with no
sicknesses or eating disturbances.  She had all her immunizations and
had chicken pox as a child. The only major medical history was having
tubes placed in her ears as a child under general anesthesia.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><U><B>Dental History</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Tiffany had no
cavities in her baby teeth but has had significant dental work done
to her permanent teeth.  She has had her wisdom teeth extracted and
experienced dry sockets.  She has had multiple root canals with each
resulting in a fracture and extraction of the tooth.  She reports
that her childhood dentist was very helpful and took time to become
knowledgeable about her condition.  This helped her to achieve a
smile that she is very happy with.  Treatment included braces for
1-1.5 years, bleaching with take-home gel and trays that was
unsuccessful, gum surgery, and veneers on her front teeth.  Her
condition has had no effect on what she eats except when she has had
a dental emergency.  She uses orajel and ibuprofen when she has a
dental emergency.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Tiffany reports
brushing twice a day and flossing 3x a week.  She never took fluoride
supplements as a child.  She reports no problems with grinding or
clenching her teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Since going off of
her parents insurance, her dental treatment has been more reactive
rather than preventive.  She would like to have her broken tooth
fixed and also have implants placed where she has missing teeth.  She
would also like to get onto a regular cleaning and exam schedule.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><U><B>Family History</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Tiffany has three
sisters and she is the only one affected with this condition on her
teeth.  Tiffany’s mother has the same condition on her teeth.  Her
maternal grandmother, aunt, 3 uncles and 4 cousins have the same
condition.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><U><B>Clinical
Findings</B></U></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Oral exam showed
Tiffany was missing teeth #12, 30, and only had root tips of #19. 
Tooth #2 has large occlusal caries and broken mesiobuccal cusp. 
Teeth #7-10 have porcelain veneers.  Her lower anterior incisors are
grayish in color with translucent enamel.  She also has signs of
significant wear/erosion on all her molars.  Most of her existing
molars have large composite fillings.  Tooth #18 distobuccal cusp is
fractured.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Periodontal charting
reveals probing depths between 1-4 mm with minimal bleeding on
probing.  She has slight recession 1-2 mm in the canine premolar
region.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Radiographs show
bulbous crowns with normal thickness of enamel.  Pulp chambers are
small and either small or calcified in the roots.  Radiographs must
have been taken before clinical photos due to the variations in
dental work.  BWX still show presence of at least one third molar.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>Osteogenesis
imperfecta:</B> An autosomal dominant condition causing extremely
fragile bones.  Classic signs include blue tint to the whites of the
eye (blue sclera), multiple bone fractures, and early hearing loss. 
About half of the people who have OI have teeth that appear normal,
and their major concerns are routine care. However, the other half
has a defect in the teeth called dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI),
sometimes referred to as opalescent teeth or brittle teeth. These
teeth may be misshapen, may chip or break easily.  Besides tooth
development issues, people with osteogenesis imperfecta also tend to
have a class three malocclusion and open bite.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>Dentinogenesis
Imperfecta:</B> is a group of inherited defects in tooth dentin that
is distinct from odontogenesis imperfecta as only the teeth are
affected. It is caused by mutations in <I>DSPP </I>(4q21.3), the gene
encoding dentin sialophosphoprotein. The teeth are blue-gray or amber
brown and opalescent. On dental radiographs, the teeth have bulbous
crowns, narrow roots, and pulp chambers and root canals that are
small or completely obliterated. Enamel may crack and shear readily
from the dentin when subjected to occlusal stress.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>Tetracycline
Stain: </B>Causes a yellow or grayish appearance to the teeth.
Tetracycline has the ability to incorporate into tissues that are
calcifying.  People who were exposed to tetracycline while teeth were
forming either as a child or while they were developing in utero can
develop this condition.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>Fluorosis:</B><FONT COLOR="#000000">
Defect to enamel caused by ingestion of too much fluoride during
tooth development.  Most cases of fluorosis are mild and will appear
as tiny white specks or streaks that are often unnoticeable. However,
in severe cases of enamel fluorosis, the appearance of the teeth is
marred by discoloration or brown markings. The enamel may be pitted,
rough, and hard to clean.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>Dentin
Dysplasia I: </B>The condition also known as “rootless” teeth has
an incidence of ~1:100.000. Clinically both permanent and primary
teeth are of normal shape, form, and color in most cases. 
Radiographically the teeth have short roots with unusual mobility,
spontaneous abscess, and early exfoliation. Crescent-shaped pulpal
remnants parallel to the CEJ in the permanent dentition and total
pulpal obliteration in the primary dentition are common features.
There are usually numerous periapical radiolucencies in non-carious
teeth.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>Dentin
Dysplasia II:</B> Dentin dysplasia type II is distinguished from DGI
because the permanent teeth are normal in color but show
“thistle-tube pulp chambers” and pulp stones on radiographs.  
The primary teeth have features of DGI.  The permanent teeth are
normal shape, form and color in most cases.  Both dentinogenisis
imperfecta and dentin dysplasia conditions are autosomal-dominant and
can be caused by mutations in the dentin sialophosphoprotein gene. 
Depending on where the mutation occurs on the DSPP gene the resulting
clinical phenotype may be dentin dysplasia or dentinogenisis
imperfecta type II or type III.

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><B>Amelogensis
Imperfecta:</B><I> </I>(AI) is a heterogeneous group of inherited
defects in dental enamel formation. The malformed enamel can be
unusually thin, soft, rough and stained. The strict definition of AI
includes only those cases where enamel defects occur in the absence
of other, non-dental, symptoms. Isolated enamel malformations are
caused by defects in a number of different genes. X-linked, autosomal
dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance are possible,
with considerable variability in the character and appearance of the
resulting enamel. Fourteen subtypes are recognized.

is an inborn metabolic disorder of the bones characterized by
skeletal defects resembling those of rickets. The symptoms result
from a failure of bone mineral to be deposited in young, uncalcified
bone (osteoid), and in the cartilage at the end of the long bones
(epiphyses) during early years. The activity of the enzyme alkaline
phosphatase in blood serum and bone cells is lower than normal.
Urinary excretion and blood serum concentrations of
phosphoethanolamine and inorganic pyrophosphate are abnormally high.
Unlike other forms of rickets, hypophosphatasia does not respond to
treatment with vitamin D.</FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Dentin Dysplasia is
an autosomal dominant genetic defect meaning it doesn’t skip a
generation.  Tiffany’s children will all have a 50% chance of being
affected if her husband doesn’t have a history of the disease. 
Dentin Dysplasia is the least severe form.  Dentinogenesis Imperfecta
type 2 and type 3 are much more severe.</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Stainless
steel crowns on molars and composite strip crowns on canines and
incisors during primary and mixed dentition stage. Full coverage
casting crowns on permanent molars to maintain vertical dimension,
composite or porcelain veneers on incisors to establish incisal
guidance and on other teeth where esthetic is critical Regular oral
and radiographic examinations to detect tooth fracture and dental
abscesses are important.</P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Teeth affected by
Dentin Dysplasia cannot support large bulky fillings, and will tend
to fracture.  Therefore, teeth needing treatment should be covered
and protected with a full crown.   Veneers are also an option for the
esthetics of anterior teeth.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In Tiffany’s case,
tooth #2 should be checked for vitality, caries removed and a build
up and crown should be placed.  If needed, she should be referred to
an endodontist to treat #2. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">If finances are not
a concern, implants should be placed to replace missing teeth.  This
will require a referral to either a periodontist or oral surgeon to
evaluate bone width and height to accommodate implants.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The distobuccal
fracture on tooth #18 should be closely evaluated to see if she needs
a full crown on that tooth as well.  Tiffany should be placed on a
regular recall, and have BWX taken every 12-18 months.
